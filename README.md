# Gloo Docs

Consolidated repo for building and deploying Gloo community and enterprise docs. 

To build these docs, clone the repo, install `hugo`, and run `make serve-site`. 

This will build the site and host it by default on `localhost:1313`. 

## Versioning

For now, we plan to maintain a version of the docs per minor version of Gloo. In the future, 
we may put other products here too and publish them all from the same repo.
