description: Definition of Upstream Groups for Multi-Destinations

Gloo supports organizing upstreams in Groups. 

## Concept

An `UpstreamGroup`  is a top-level object, that, as the name says, allows you to logically group upstreams, giving you the ability to address them as a group in distinct VirtualServices. An upstream is the language we use to define something that will receive the traffic from Envoy, and itâ€™s where you want your request to go ultimately.

Among other use cases, Upstream Groups can be very useful if you're running Canary Deployments or A/B tests. By having a top-level *object* that specifies your destinations, multiple virtual services can refer to the same top-level `UpstreamGroup`.

In the example above, when you change the destinations or the weights for the cartService `UpstreamGroup`, all users of the the `UpstreamGroup` will be impacted.
### Create your Upstream Group

```yaml
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: UpstreamGroup
metadata:
  name: cartServiceUG
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  destinations:
  - destination:
    upstream:
        name: cartServiceV3
        namespace: gloo-system
    weight: 95
  - destination:
      upstream:
        name: cartServiceV4
        namespace: gloo-system
    weight: 5
```

As you can seem on the example Yaml above, an UpstreamGroup inherits the Multi-Action capability from Routes, meaning you can define weights, which, as said above, can be useful for Canary Deployments or A/B tests.

### Use your Upstream Group

Once you create your UpstreamGroup, they can be used inside the Route section of you Virtual service.

See below an example Yaml for a `virtualService` that uses the `upstreamGroup` defined above.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: vs
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*'
    name: default
    routes:
    - matcher:
        prefix: /
      routeAction:
        upstreamGroup:
          name: cartServiceUG
          namespace: gloo-system
```

Together with Upstream Groups, there are now three types of actions that can be specified in a route:

- Single Action
- Multi Action
- Upstream Group
