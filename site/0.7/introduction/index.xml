      <description>Overview Component Architecture Discovery Architecture  
Overview Gloo aggregates back end services and provides function-to-function translation for clients, allowing decoupling from back end APIs
Clients issue requests or emit events to routes defined on Gloo. These routes are mapped to functions on upstream services by Gloo&amp;rsquo;s configuration (provided by clients of Gloo&amp;rsquo;s API).
Clients connect to proxies managed by Gloo who then transform requests into function invocations for a variety of functional backends.</description>

      <description>Overview Virtual Services  Routes Matchers Destinations  Upstreams  Functions  Secrets  
Overview The two top-level concepts in Gloo are Virtual Services and Upstreams.
 Virtual Services define a set of route rules that live under a domain or set of domains. Route rules consist of a matcher, which specifies the kind of function calls to match (requests and events, are currently supported), and the name of the destination (or destinations) to route them to.</description>
